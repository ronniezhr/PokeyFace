By linking with Facebook profile, we can match people's photos to the most 
resembled pokomon. People can choose their preferences of the pokemon types.
After players find their matching pokemon, they can then post the pokemon 
picture on Facebook and get level up and skills by increasing number of Likes.
The probability of pokemon matches is compatible with the rareness of the
pokemon. In addition, players who are in a relationship will have additional HP
bonus and can lay pokemon eggs. The eggs can be given to other players and
replace their current pokemon.

After getting the pokemon information, players can fight with their friends.
We use the random algorithm to simulate the result of the fighting.
